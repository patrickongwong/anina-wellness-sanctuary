     INSTAGRAM — live "Follow along" feed
     ---------------------------------------------------------
     A static site can't pull a profile feed by itself (Instagram
     needs an access token that must NOT live in a public repo).
     The standard fix is a free widget service that holds the token
     for you and gives you an embed snippet. See README → "Live
     Instagram feed" for 3-minute setup (LightWidget / Behold / etc).

     Fill ONE of these:
       • EMBED_HTML     — paste the full <iframe>/<script> snippet the
                          widget service gives you (works with any of them)
       • LIGHTWIDGET_ID — just the id from a LightWidget embed
                          (e.g. the "abc123..." in lightwidget.com/widgets/abc123.html)

     Leave both empty to show the on-brand fallback grid that links
     to the profile below.
